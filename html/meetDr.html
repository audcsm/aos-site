                        <h2>Background</h2>
                        <h5>Dr. Dennis C. Smith has been doing bariatric surgery since 1997, when he practiced in Biloxi, MS. In 1999 he began developing a technique for the biliopancreatic diversion with Duodenal Switch to be done completely laparoscopically, which he first performed in November, 1999. He moved from Biloxi to Marietta, Georgia in late 1999.</h5>
                        <h5>Having put together the elements of a bariatric surgery program with the highest possible standards, Dr. Smith in June, 2002 formed his own practice devoted exclusively to bariatric surgery, in order to better serve the morbidly obese population.</h5>
