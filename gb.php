                <p>The Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y (RNY) Gastric Bypass, sometimes referred to as the "Gastric Bypass" or the "RNY" has been the most commonly performed bariatric operation over the past 20 years. The RNY Gastric Bypass achieves weight loss well in all weight ranges, and does so reliably with a strong long-term safety record. It has therefore remained a very popular choice among bariatric surgeons and weight loss surgery patients alike. The Laparoscopic RNY Gastric Bypass has a weight loss potential in the range of 70-75% of the excess body weight, on average, and the weight loss is fairly well sustained.</p>
                <br />
                <h2>The Gastric Bypass Operation</h2>
                <p>The Laparoscopic RNY Gastric Bypass makes a small pouch at the top of the stomach, and then routes the food through a "Roux" limb of small bowel before it joins the biliopancreatic or digestive secretions. This means there is restriction as well as some mild malabsorption at work in helping you lose weight. You'll feel full after eating just a few bites of food. Many patients have little interest in sweets after surgery, and find themselves craving healthier foods. The Gastric Bypass is mostly restrictive, but there is a malabsorptive component to it that helps achieve more weight loss than with restrictive operations alone.</p>
                <p>The RNY requires 6 very small incisions, and Dr. Smith do a leak test while in the OR to ensure everything looks good. You'll usually stay 1 night in the hospital, and be able to get back to normal activities over the next couple of weeks. Our patients are usually back to work with no restrictions in 2 weeks from having their Gastric Bypass surgery.</p>

                        <h3>Follow-Up and Support</h3>
                        <p>With the RNY, as with the other types of bariatric surgery, you'll need to take extra vitamins and supplements to stay healthy, and we'll monitor you and your lab values for life to make sure you stay healthy. We provide lots of education, support, and follow-up to make sure you stay as healthy as possible. We also help you maximize your weight loss, and your maintenance of your weight loss.</p>
                        <p><em>Our follow-up is lifelong.</em> After your surgery you will be part of our program for life - we'll monitor you progress, keep watch on your nutrition, and provide support so that you can maximize and maintain your weight loss in a sustainable way.</p>

                <h2>Dr. Smith and RNY Gastric Bypass</h2>
                <p>Dr. Smith has been doing laparoscopic weight loss surgery for more than 15 years, and is one of the leaders in doing safe and high quality laparoscopic weight loss surgery, including the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass.</p>
                <p>Dr. Smith performs all of his Bariatric Surgery operations, including the Gastric Bypass, totally laparoscopically, and has for many years. He has been involved with the development of techniques in the performance of laparoscopic bariatric surgery, and continues to serve as faculty for bariatric surgery courses, teaching other bariatric surgeons.</p>
