                <h5>The Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Duodenal Switch procedure, sometimes known as the Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch, combines restriction (eating less because you feel full more quickly) with malabsorption of fat to give you a very powerful bariatric surgery procedure. You may have heard of the Duodenal Switch procedure referred to as the BPD/DS, the "Duodenal Switch", the "DS", or simply the "Switch".</h5>
                <h5>Dr. Dennis Smith performs the Totally Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Duodenal Switch, with a Hand-Sewn Duodenal-Ileal Anastomosis. Dr. Smith was one of the first bariatric surgeons in the world to perform this Duodenal Switch surgery completely laparoscopically, and the first bariatric surgeon in the world to present the Hand-Sewn Duodenal-Ileal Anastomosis Technique of the Laparoscopic Duodenal Switch. There are very few bariatric surgeons in the world who regularly perform the Totally Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Duodenal Switch procedure.</h5>

                        <h2>What is the Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Duodenal Switch?</h2>
                        <h5>The Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Duodenal Switch gives you the best weight loss (an average of around 80-85% of excess body weight) of the four major types of surgery, with few side effects. It also provides the most durable weight loss, with the best protection against weight regain over the years. The operation includes a "Partial Lateral Gastrectomy", also known as a "Sleeve Gastrectomy" that gives you significant restriction in how much you can eat. The Sleeve Gastrectomy portion of the operation also helps alter the hormonal impulses that come from the stomach, resulting in less feelings of hunger.</h5>

                <h5>The complete Duodenal Switch operation also involves the small bowel bypass component, sometimes referred to as the "Duodenal Switch" portion of the operation, which adds malabsorption. This rearranges the small bowel, bypassing a significant portion of the small bowel, so that there is some malabsorption of the fat that you eat. The small bowel bypass causes a diversion of your food stream, keeping it from mixing with the digestive juices until much later in the small bowel. It is only in the last 100 cm or so, the "common channel", that your food can mix with your digestive juices stream, in order to be digested and absorbed. The overall result is a powerful combination of a "restrictive" and a "malabsorptive" weight loss, that is the best and most durable weight loss of any of the four major bariatric procedures.</h5>
                <h5>The Laparoscopic Duodenal Switch is especially good for you if you have a great deal of weight to lose, if you have severe insulin dependent diabetes, or if you have hypertriglyceridemia. As your stomach stretches out with time, you would usually be able to eat relatively more afterward, however the stomach is limited in its ability to stretch. This operation does require adherence to a postoperative diet for best results, as does the Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass. Dr. Smith performs all of his Duodenal Switch operations totally laparoscopically.</h5>

                        <h3>Weight Loss Mechanism</h3>
                        <h5>The Duodenal Switch operation usually obtains the best weight loss (an average of around 80-85% of excess body weight) of the three operations. The most important feature of the operation is that it diverts the food stream so that it is only in the last 75-100 cm, the “common channel”, that the food can mix with the digestive stream, in order to be digested and absorbed. The result is a "malabsorptive" weight loss. The reduction of the size of the stomach, to about 60 - 80 cc in volume, also results in a restrictive component on weight loss. As a result, this operation provides a mixed malabsorptive and restrictive weight loss, that is the best preserved weight-loss of all the bariatric procedures.</h5>
                        <h3>Preservation of Pyloric Valve</h3>
                        <h5>Also very important is the fact that the Duodenal Switch procedure preserves the pylorus, the valve that regulates emptying of the stomach, with preservation of several centimeters of the duodenum. This means dumping and marginal ulcers are much less a problem than with the Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass. The normal satiety mechanism is preserved as well.</h5>

                <h3>Malabsorption</h3>
                <h5>Problems with the Duodenal Switch operation are malabsorptive in nature, largely, but most can be managed, when they occur, by taking supplements. The major complication to worry about with this surgery in the long-term is protein malabsorption, which should occur about 1% of the time if done in this configuration. If patients are being followed appropriately, this is usually caught early, and can be managed very well with adjustment of the type and quality of protein the patient is consuming, the addition of pancreatic enzymes, and then if necessary, surgical lengthening of the common channel to improve absorption. This can usually be done so that the patient’s protein absorption is improved without the patient gaining substantial weight.</h5>
                <h5>Malabsorption of the fat-soluble vitamins, Vitamins A, D, E and K, are also potentially at risk, and these must be followed as well. Prolonged, uncorrected deficiencies of these Vitamins can be very serious, leading to problems such as night blindness (Vitamin A deficiency) and immune system compromise (Vitamin E deficiency). These can also be managed well with supplements if the deficiency can be caught early.</h5>
                <h3>Lifelong Follow-Up</h3>
                <h5>Patients who have the Duodenal Switch procedure must absolutely have lifelong medical follow-up, since the side effects can be subtle, and can appear months to years after the surgery. Sometimes diarrhea and foul smelling gas are problems, but they are usually just a minor nuisance. Leaks and obstructions are possible. Iron and Calcium absorption are also a concern with this operation, as with the Gastric Bypass. As mentioned above, nutritional and vitamin deficiencies are possible, but most can be managed with supplements. Protein malnutrition is potentially a major problem, but it is rare with proper follow-up, and can be managed by lengthening of the common channel. There is also the possibility of liver failure, although this is an extremely unusual complication, and would require extreme non-compliance on the part of the patient.</h5>

                <h2>Dr. Smith's Experience</h2>
                <h5>Dr. Smith has performed over 750 Totally Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy with Duodenal Switch Procedures. He continues to do these procedures regularly, and our patients are from all over the US. We generally have relatively short wait times from your initial contact with our office to your surgery date, depending on what insurance and medical situations you have.</h5>
                <h5>Dr. Smith's safety record is among the best, and that's because his focus is, and has always been, on doing the safest surgery possible. He takes the time to make sure each patient is taken care of as thoroughly and carefully as possible, pre-operatively, during surgery, and post-operatively. Dr. Smith also serves as faculty for courses in the Duodenal Switch for bariatric surgeons who are interested in adding the Duodenal Switch to their bariatric surgery armamentarium. He also has presented his Laparoscopic Duodenal Switch techniques and results at national and international meetings of bariatric surgeons.</h5>
